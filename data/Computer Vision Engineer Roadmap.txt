Let us take the case of Deep Learning. Understanding DL models forms a significant part of Computer Vision, and once again, Calculus concepts are used widely. For instance, the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks is based on calculus.

Feature extraction is another Computer Vision task. It involves extracting meaningful features from images which is also made possible by Calculus. Take the instance of SIFT or Scale-invarient feature transform and edge detection. Facilitated by Calculus, they are able to identify key points and features in an image that are essential for tasks like image matching and object recognition. 

Motion analysis and tracking also use Calculus. How so? Derivatives are calculated in space and time to understand how objects move in a scene. 

Understanding the principles of Calculus is key to understanding CV algorithms and techniques.

Probability and Statistics
CV deals with a lot of uncertainties and variability in data. This is where Probability and Statistics come in. Let us look at a few of them.

Optimizations of Deep Learning models are made possible with Statistical techniques. Methods like stochastic gradient descent rely on probabilistic approaches to find optimal parameters for neural networks.  

Statistical methods are used to detect and track objects in a sequence of images or video. The movement of objects is predicted using probabilistic models.

Machine Learning models that form a big chunk of Computer Vision also use Probability and Statistics. Models such as CNNs or Convolutional Neural Networks use statistical data to recognize and classify patterns in images.

Programming
Programming forms another important part of Computer Vision. Let us see why.

Before any images or videos can be analyzed, they need preprocessing. This is where programming comes into the picture. They are used to perform tasks like normalizing data, image resizing, and noise filtration.

At the core of Computer Vision, we have algorithms. Tasks such as object detection, image classification, or pattern recognition are implemented with algorithms. And you guessed it right, programming is used to create these algorithms. 

With most applications, CV algorithms are required to operate in real time. Once again, Programming comes to the rescue by optimizing the algorithms for speed and efficiency, ensuring live video feeds can be processed quickly.


Many CV tasks leverage ML and DL techniques. With programming, the performance of these models are optimized and integrated into larger systems. This involves working with neural networks, setting up training pipelines, and using Vision libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

In an academic or research environment that involves exploring new computer vision techniques, programming is used to conduct experiments and validate hypotheses.

The next question arises, which language do I start with? Let us explore a few of them.

Pattern recognition is very crucial in visual data. This is important for tasks like object recognition, where the system identifies and classifies objects within images or videos. This is made possible with machine learning algorithms.

Another key aspect of understanding the context of visual data is feature detection and extraction. It includes identifying key points, edges, and shapes in images. Once again, ML comes to the rescue by detecting and extracting features.

Machine learning algorithms can analyze and interpret images and videos to detect anomalies, track movements, and even predict future occurrences based on visual cues.

Then there is semantic segmentation, which is the process where each pixel in an image is classified into a category, helping in understanding the scene at a more detailed level. Machine learning makes this possible.


Machine learning algorithms can also track objects in motion across frames in a video, which is crucial in surveillance, sports analysis, and autonomous vehicles.

Machine learning enhances AR and VR experiences by enabling real-time image processing and interaction with the environment.

It is done for the enhancement of an existing image to get the relevant information from it. Image processing is an essential preprocessing step in many applications like object detection and face recognition. For instance, in the entertainment industry, image manipulation is used to add or remove objects to images. Let us explore them.

Image Enhancement
Image enhancement in image processing for computer vision refers to a set of techniques used to improve the visual appearance of an image or to convert the image to a be better suited for analysis by humans or computer algorithms. This process is crucial in preparing images for further tasks in computer vision, such as feature extraction, object detection, and classification. The goal is often to increase the quality of the original image from the perspective of an observer or to enhance certain image features important for further processing. Why is Image enhancement crucial? Let us see why.

Image enhancement aids in contrast adjustments. With techniques like histogram equalization or contrast stretching, pixel intensity is modified for clearer images.
The image brightness is enhanced by adjusting pixel values, either simply or through complex methods.
Image smoothening is performed by minimizing random brightness or color variations using methods like Gaussian blurring, median, or bilateral filtering.
It also performs edge enhancements by making image edges more distinct and leveraging techniques like unsharp masking, laplacian filters, and high-pass filters.
Color Balance and Saturation: Improving visual appeal or emphasis by correcting color temperature and enhancing color vividness.
Deblurring: Restoring sharpness to blurred images caused by motion or focus issues.
Geometric Processing: Manipulating image structures for noise removal, object separation, or shape emphasis.
Image Restoration
Image restoration is the process of enhancing the quality of an image by removing noise. Although there are a few similarities with image enhancement, the latter leverages the characteristics of the human visual system for better-looking results. In image restoration, the original image quality is high but in certain conditions. Here are a few aspects of image restoration.

One of the key aspects of image restoration is removing noise from images like Gaussian noise or speckle noise.
Another aspect is improving the resolution of an image. This could be enlarging lower-resolution images by increasing the number of pixels in an image.
Blurring of images is another common problem. This could be due to out-of-focus captures or other factors. This is tackled by estimating the blur patterns or blur kernel and reversing its effects. 
Color correction is another important aspect of image restoration. For instance, some images will have color distortions, or older images will have faded colors. Such images will need color correction by adjusting the color balance of images.

Inpainting to do Image Restoration

Image Compression
Image compression is the process of applying data compression on digital images. The intent behind this is to optimize the size of the image data to make it more storable and transmittable. It can be broadly classified into

Lossless compression
This process refers to making smaller versions of an image without compromising the quality of the image. It is a reversible process, and the image parts are still intact. 

Lossy compression 
In this process, the image size is reduced by removing some parts of the image. We will get a significantly smaller version of the image, making it much faster to load with minimal quality difference. One of the downsides is unlike the lossless compression, this is not reversible. 

Image Manipulation
Image manipulation is the process of modifying digital images. This step is done to improve image quality or create visual effects. Here are a few uses of image manipulation

Image processing assists with filtering. It is a commonly used technique for blurring, sharpening, or edge detection that forms a fundamental part of image processing.

Another aspect is composite image creation which involves combining different images to create a new image commonly used in advertising.

Not only putting images together but also dividing them into different parts is performed with image manipulation. This is done based on the characteristics of the pixels in an image. 

We can also perform operations such as dilation, opening and closing, and erosion which find use in image pre-processing, especially with binary images through Morphological processing.
